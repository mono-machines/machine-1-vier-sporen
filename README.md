ISD1820 Lofi Sampler


Thank you for being here! Feel free to browse around and (re)use all you want. Just promise me you will make awesome machines too and share it with the world. ‚úåüèº

# Introduction
While watching a build video by Lauri (see link below) I was very much charmed by the (lofi) IC that was used, namely the ISD1820 voice recorder chip. Then the idea came to mind to build my own interpretation or iteration of the sampler. Not only bacause it sounded great, but also as a starting point for me to learn about electronic instrument building and what it all entails. So, this is my first project, from start to finish although the main circuit (in far extent) was given. Here you will find all relevant files and resources so you can either build one yourself or iterate further and make it into something else.

# Disclaimer

Although I am trying my best to deliver the best quality standards I am still an amateur, an imposter in many fields of electronic instrument building. Therefor you may question my methods or raise an eyebrow every now and then. If it really is concerning, drop me a comment or write me an email and I will try to fix it or at least learn from it. Take in mind that this whole thing for me is a way to learn and get better and to make it into something I can spend my working days doing.
